Bluffing is an essential mechanic of the game. It is a class of battle action which temporarily change your stats to affect enemy behavior during the turn, but each "bluff" skill has its backlash.

## Some Example Bluffs:

### Fake Death:
- Goal: Set character status to "DEAD" so the enemy won't target that character.
- Why use it: 
1. A character is in a fragile state but you don't want to lose that character.
2. When facing enemies that does group damage on all living targets, your characters can take turn to act "Dead" to suffer the least damage. 
- Backlash: 
1. "Dead" character cannot perform any active actions during fake death. (But can still regenerate hp) 
2. Require a living party member to spend a turn to then revive the "DEAD" Character.
3. If there is no living member left, it's Game Over. 
4. If battle concluded before you revived the "DEAD" character, you lose that character. (This effect can be negated by a consumable item)

### Bloodletting:
- Goal: Lower character hp at the very start of the battle. Enemies will choose a light attack on you instead of the heavy attack. Then, add the hp back bit by bit during the battle, win by exhausting the enemy's AP.
- Example: You: 100hp -> 50hp; Enemy: inf hp, 60AP left, Light Attack: 30DMG-20AP; Heavy Attack: 100DMG-50AP. Enemy chooses light attack, You add the HP back, they can't kill you anymore.

When to use it:
1. For strong enemies with not much ap left.
