Young Ball with distinguished stats. Will have 3 skills of the same module (at random) at start. <br>
Eli is deemed to be Mother's best work.
`The [human error footages](https://github.com/ZiDiZhu/human-error) documented a snippet of the development stage of project ORB. Many historians theorize that the footages recorded in first person was from an early Eli model. The early Eli model is shown to be prone to unpredictable and destructive behaviors. As a correction to Eli models' defiant behaviors, Mother took drastic measures including: Mass cloning Eli's for genetic selection; putting Eli clones through rigorous training in order strengthen certain genetic traits over generations.` <br>
After long years of evolution, the Eli model today is finally, almost a finished work, close to embody the perfection of the ORB. The biggest bottleneck at the moment is the massive amount of resources required to perform the final upgrade - in an already depleted world, to make that happen can mean the sacrifice of other life - which is already scarce. <br>
- #### Final Form: ORB
The ORB takes the form of a sentient neutron star. Once it became Massive enough to warp the space around it, it couldn't stop absorbing everything around it <br>

<br>[The ORB ending] Collecting all learning modules and install on Eli, and Having all basic stats reach max (10), You will need to kill some other characters to obtain their learning module. and before trigger the Orb transformation, if Eli's basic stats are maxed out, an ORB skill will be learned automatically which is to absorb everything. After a set amount of absorption used, ORB ending will be triggered.
