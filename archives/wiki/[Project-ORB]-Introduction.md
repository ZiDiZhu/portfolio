Project ORB (Working Title), a concept by indie game developer Zi Di Zhu, is a video game that can be broadly classified as an RPG. Its gameplay primarily encompasses turn-based battles, exploration, and interactive dialogues. <br>
Set in a futuristic human civilization, the game's world unfolds in an era where the Martian Colony dispatches its inaugural voyage to Earth, a century after the Apocalyptic Final War ravaged the planet. <br>

## Turn-Based Battle Design
A pivotal goal of Project ORB is to develop a robust turn-based battle system which includes diverse modes of interactions, turning each battle into a unique challenge which requires keen observation of game behaviors, puzzle-solving by observing game's logic, enemy behavior, and strategic utilization of actions and resources. <br>
Each mechanic has a narrative function, offering an immersive yet subversive RPG experience.

Some highlights of battle design includes:
### 1. Modular body parts
Characters feature detachable body parts including limbs, eyes, and some organs. Each with unique stats and abilities. Players can detach and reattach these parts to create various "builds" to maximize the party's battle ability and exploration skills. <br>
For example, weapons requires one or both arms to use, each weapon has a weight, requiring the character to have arm(s) that has an equal or higher lifting power. 
Eyes determines precision, Legs determine agility, stomach allows food consumption and heart determines max HP, etc. Body parts can be damaged and no longer usable, player must assign these parts to the party strategically.
### 2. Action Synergy & Battle Friendship:
Characters possess skill sets that, when combined, can either enhance (forming a "combo") or diminish (causing a "conflict") the effectiveness of actions. Friendships develop between characters through these combos, influencing overall gameplay. 
### 3. Puzzle-like battles:
Battles in the game can be fought, resolved or mitigated in many ways. Notably through the [Bluffing](https://github.com/ZiDiZhu/speculative-2/wiki/BLUFFING) mechanic. Other in-game interactions, friendship, equipped limbs, inventory items can all have an effect on the current battle. Like the combos/conflict performed by party members, some player actions can also neutralize or deflect enemy actions.
### 4. Control Limitations:
The player (YOU, not your POV character) has an Action Points (AP) stat that regenerates each turn which allows the player to make choices for the characters. Characters themselves can always autonomously make decisions, which may not always align with the player's wishes. Player can make a cost-free decision to "leave the choice to your character.", or spend AP to give a definitive instruction.  When player is low on AP or a character becomes "rogue", player's control over that character becomes limited.

## Narrative Design
Project ORB features branching dialogue system akin to visual novel games, the narrative decisions are closely tied battle events and world exploration. Some highlights of the game's narrative design includes:
### 1. Player being “The 6th Sense”
The player embodies the role of a decision-making AI God's brain, "The 6th Sense." Most characters, implanted with control chips, adhere to player commands. However, conflicting orders may lead characters to "go rogue" and remove these chips, acting independently and concealing their inventory and status from the player, adding complexity to resource management.
### 2. Multiple POV characters.
The diverse cast represents various social classes and planetary backgrounds, each with unique motivations and goals. The narrative perspective shifts throughout the game, offering different viewpoints on the unfolding story.
### 3. Characters with Motivations
Character behavior is mainly based on their innate motivation. Some characters have straight-forward motivations while others have more concealed/hidden motivations that the player must find out through playing and observing the game. Aforementioned battle friendship can also have a minor effect on character behavior, and can contribute to a character's change in motivation.


## World Design
Project ORB sets in a speculative future world where the Earth's Surface is mostly covered in Oceans, humans are genetically altered to survive extreme conditions. The rich has settled on terraformed Mars, and the remainder of humanity are scatter around Earth's doomsday bunkers, the Moon Base, and Space Fleets orbiting around the sun.
### 1. Immersive environmental storytelling
Project ORB embeds its lore in each consumable item, each equipment and each character skill. Environmental storytelling of the game reflects in every stage of interaction player has with the game - Battle, Dialogue or Exploration.
### 2. Character's Affinity with locations
Your Character or Party has a reputation stat in each location. (Reputation may spread through neighboring areas) Having a positive reputations grants you benefits and having a negative reputation will make the area more hostile towards you. Each situation will reveal a different perspective. 
### 3. Mixed-Medium cutscenes
The game's main artistic experiment is in its cutscenes. 
A variety of mixed techniques will be used for the cutscenes of the game, including animatics, stop-motion animation, animated 2D and 3D character models, and potentially live-action.
