The ORB (spelled in all caps) has been pondered on since the ancient times of wizard. <br>
Humanity has, throughout history, spent immense effort trying to obtain perfection, through magic, alchemy and science, though many sees this effort as pointless - as true perfection can neither be defined nor achieved, and the obsession with the ORB will lead to madness and destruction. Many others believe ORB is the entity that is guiding humanity towards enlightenment, and that the ORB was responsible for all our scientific advances, from the discovery of the holy mathematical constant PI, to harnessing the power of nuclear energy.<br>

During the Final War, sources say that the world government has begun the secret Project ORB, many believes the acronym is for "Obliterative Radiation Bomb", sources say it's what destroyed the night's eye. <br>
Government does not confirm the existence of Project ORB, and for a long time after the Vanishing of the Night's Eye, Project ORB was seen as a forgotten conspiracy.

Mother is the leader of Project ORB. <br>
The person of unknown name who later become "Mother" was born before the Final war and spent most of their youth as an middling computer games developer in a failing economy. Most of their original works can't be found, but a group of historians are searching for these works as they believe that these games may contain important clues about Project ORB. <br>
Not much is known about Mother or the final outcome of project ORB. <br>
`Project ORB was inspired by a concept in one of Mother's computer games. It has garnered attention from [The Sponsors]. [The Sponsors] were drawn by the visions of a colony of genetically perfected human clones that will build a perfect utopia and begin the age of space travel.` <br>
`The name Mother: is because project ORB is a human cloning and genetic engineering program. Many human clones were created and then discarded, including 271827 Eli clones, 577 Fiz clones, 999 Gizmo clones` <br>
` In her late years, Mother was driven by the fear of death and created clones and backups of herself in many formats (the process of encrypting large amount of data has mined immense resources and caused many natural disasters). The original consciousness is transferred onto a bunny plushie`
