The Blender is where they send fresh organic materials (including people) to process into GOUP or ration. <br>
`Project ORB sends their human clones here to dispose of their bodies after genetic data has been collected.` <br>
Goup is a consumer product sold in markets, ration can be obtained through ration tickets.

Eating meals during combat can waste you a turn of actions, and food takes up inventory space, restaurants are therefore great places to get food and form bond. <br>
Each character has a favorite food, if you order their favorite, their MP gains an extra boost.

Restaurant and Food Queue conversations work the same way but different art, + restaurant you order food and spend money and rations you get the amount from the coupons you spend.
